            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110941:3"/>men enjoy therein, a sufficient reason to engage a Countrey in a civill warre; for so it would be a Rebellion, rather then a defensive warre. These foure therefore aforesaid, being the common intentions of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and we must all meet and concurre, neither fighting for the one, nor the other, but for all; otherwise the Argument, Ground, and Reason of such a Warre, will prove er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oneous and fallacious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Warre when the causes are united; this is when the Warre is undertaken for Gods glory, the Kings Honour, the Parliament and the Countreys preservation. It will be an unjust and unlawfull Warre, when for the pleasing of the King, and satisfying his demands, some of the subjects combine against the rest, to exalt his desires, having neither love, equitie, nor Religion on their sides to assure their consciences that they fight the Lords Battels as well as the Kings. And moreover, if the Countrey should resist the true and lawfull commands of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and desire rather to eglarge their own liberty against Law, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to preserve them by Law, or any way to despise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the power of their aunointed King and Soveraigne; such a War ensuing from the unbounded and unlimited humour of the Commons, is by the Law of God, and the Law of the Land to be accounted no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then those Rebelious which were in the former Raigns of severall Kings of <hi>England.</hi> But the Parliament have first endeavoured in all dutifull and loyall manner to apply themselves unto his Majestie, and laboured by humble prayers, and cleare and convincing reasons and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in severall Petitions to satisfie Him in their just intentions and proceedings, for the safety of his Royall Person, and the peace of the Kingdome. And finding that all their endeavours and labours were frustrated and made vaine by his Majesties evill Counsellours, who have not only withdrawn his much desired presence from them, but also so wrought upon him by their pernicious advise and counsell, so that they have made him raise summes in the North, under pretence of a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Guard, thereby to exercise hostility on his loving Subjects; to make sharp returns and bitter expressions against the Parliaments. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to manifest an intention of desiring the possession of <hi>Hull,</hi> the command of the Fleet, and the Magazine, which being committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Papists, the Parliament should be exposed to the mercy of the enemies, who would convert such forces and such places entrusted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110941:3"/>to them unto the ruine of the Parliament, the destruction of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Lawes and liberties of the Subject, to indure Papistry, change the forme of Government of this Kingdome, and make it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Arbitrary power of the King, that so a few evill counsellours having speciall influence on his affections, might under his power and Prerogative squeeze the subjects purses, and be all Viceroys under the Kings matters. Therefore being come to such an apparent point of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the Parliament cannot conside in the Kings good intentions towards them, when he opposes them in all things, suffering also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with sharpe invectives to scandalize their persons, while the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party striveth by all means to overthrow and dissolve this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and by cutting it up by the roots, to take away all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and consequently the liberty of the Subjects, thereby preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and maintained. Upon these grounds and motives the whole body of the Commons, of what County or Shire soever, according to their protestations formerly taken, and many exhibited petitions unto the House of Parliament, ought in duty, and by the bond and obligation of their Religion, not to stand still and see the State distressed, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament oppressed, and the King possessed by the evill Counsells of the malignant party. But on the contrary to expeie their lives and fortunes for the defence and maintenance of the true Religion, the Kings Person, Honour, and Estate, the rights and liberties of the Parliament, and the Subject, and the defence of their Countrey against all tyranny and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary government.</p>
            <p>And that the Commons may the better understand the cause and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel which they undertake, and from thence have their courages quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and their mindes animated, when they understand what and how great the matters are which now lie at stake, and are to be wonne or lost by the sword, since such great controversies are not to be tryed in any Court of Judicature: but when wrong and injustice and the alteration of Religion is imposed on this Kingdome, all the Commons and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, must every one with cheerefull willingnesse, appeare ready to spend their lives <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> that is, for Religion, their King, the Parliament, and their Countrey.</p>
            <p>And first for Religion.</p>
            <p>All true hearted Subjects ought to fight to maintaine the purity and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110941:4"/>substance thereof, that it may not be changed into the ceremonious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Popery, in that their consciences may not be brought into the subjection of the Roman slavery.</p>
            <p>That the sunne of the Gospel now shining cleer in the Scriptures, which the common people are now permitted to read, may not be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by the darke mists of Popety, who desiring to keep the Laity in ignorance, deny them to peruse the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>That they may not be subject to the Popes tyrannie, inforced to pay him tribute to maintaine his fat kitchin, nor have loads imposed on them of Penance, Confession, and a rable of humane traditions.</p>
            <p>That they may not be lewdly led by the ambitious Clergy, who for profit will lead on the people till they both fall into hell, and will frame Religion to be conformable to their own lusts and desires, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themselves, though they starve the soules of the people. For these reasons therefore, the subject should defend the Protestant Religion, since being true and sincere, they are bound to maintain the true faith.</p>
            <p>The Subjects also are by the duty of allegiance bound to defend and maintain the Kings Person, Honour, and Estate.</p>
            <p>That his Person may not alwayes be environed by those who carry him upon his own enemy, and the destruction of all his people.</p>
            <p>That those wicked counsellours which have thus farre engaged the Kings Honour into the pitty of the Subjects, who grieve to see that his good and mercifull temper should be so wrought on, that he should yeeld to appear as a defendet of Delinquents and false Counsellours against his loving Subjects and loyall Parliament, in this case to set the King free and right in the opinion of his Subjects; the Subject ought, and is bound to maintaine the Kings Honour.</p>
            <p>That the King may gaine the love and respect of his Subjects, for He thereby evill counsell seeks to deprive him of that, doth as much as in him lyeth divest him of his Royall Authority, fince the love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His true Subjects is a stronger defence unto the Kings Majesty, then all power and Prerogative which He hath over this Kingdom; and therefore all endeavours ayming to worke a seperation betweene His Majesty and His Subjects, in matter of love and mutuall correspondence, do take away his power and glory, and so by consequent his Kingdom; for what is a King without power and glory, and estumation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110941:4"/>his Subjects; and therefore such as labour and strive to effect this, and to lose him the hearts of his Subjects in his owne Kingdome, are to be accounted enemies to the peace of the Kingdome; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore War is to be maintained against them as the Kings enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus War undertaken for Gods cause, for Religion, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the true Protestant faith, is the reason why we should fight for the King, who hath so often promised in his Declarations, to be the defender thereof; so that if Religion suffer as it is like to do, by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the malignant party, drawing the King to communicate in their designes, and making him guilty as much as they can of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious purposes; that so they may under his power and Autherity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect themselves from any condigne punishment. In this case the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament who are the eyes, eares, and understanding of the Common wealth, are much wronged in the charge intrusted unto them by their Countreys; and therefore when this wise Senate and Parliament that doth thus oppose it selfe against the Kings affections, misled by evill counsellours, is drawne into danger, contempt, and dissolution; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive Warre, not to resist, but to withstand the exuberane of the Kings power may be tollerated and leavied for these ends.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament may not by the malignant party be destroyed, nor they become masters of our Religion and liberties to make us slaves,</p>
            <p>That the government of this Kingdome may not be reduced to the condition of some other Countries, which are not governed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Lawes, but by the will of the Prince and his Favourites.</p>
            <p>That the malignant party may be prevented of their purposes, who seeking to ruine this Parliament here, thereby combined to cut up the freedome of Parliament by the roote, and take all Parliaments away; or which is worse matter then the instruments of slander; and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Subject of all freedome and liberty. Neither can the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be any way distressed in their just proceedings; but the Country taking notice thereof, and of their apparent danger, preparations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to ruine us all, and to compell the Traine Bands to come in and fight against their Countrey: In this case the Countrey is to be made anotive of Warre for our friends fathers, wives, children, and posterity are not to be neglected in whose defence we ought to fight for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110941:5"/>our Countrey. First, that Gods true Religion may be maintained therein, and Papistry utterly expelled: And this Religion bindes us to defend the Kings Person and Honour, abused by wicked Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and all His friends and loving Subjects, and especially the Parliament, the Representative bodie of the Commons. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the prosperity and peace of the Countrey and whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and upon these foure reasons defensive Armes may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by the Subjects, and the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> to Gods glory, and the Kingdomes Honour.</p>
            <p>Ordered by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, that the Sheriffes of the Countie, of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and likewise the Lords Lievetenants of the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in their absence, their Deputies allowed by Parliament, and the Iustices of Peace, and all others his Maiesties Officers shall suppresse all forces that shall be raised, or gathered together in those Counties, either to force the Towne of <hi>Hull,</hi> to stop the passages, to, and from the same; or in any other way to disturbe the peace of the Kingdome.</p>
